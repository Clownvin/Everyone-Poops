This simple mod makes animals defecate on solid blocks they're standing on. Now.. why on earth would you want animals to poop all over your world? Simple: Fertilizer. Each animal has a chance to defecate each tick, with pigs having nearly twice the chance as any other animal, and chickens and parrots barely pooping at all. Don't worry! Other than the pig, most animals only do their business about once a day or longer, and the dung piles disintegrate over time, with rain tripling this speed.

 

The pile of dung will continue to grow if animals keep pooping on that tile, until it forms a solid block after 8 times. This DOES mean that if you don't clean your fenced animal pens out, animals could escape! Dung piles will also slowly decay over time, so only the most crammed of animal pens should have massive dung accumulation. You can break the dung pile at any time to retrieve a dung item for each layer. Each Dung item acts as bonemeal, and can also be thrown, for memes.
